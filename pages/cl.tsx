        Dear Hiring Manager,
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        I am writing to express my interest in a Full-Stack Developer position at the company. With over six years of experience building and maintaining scalable web applications using Ruby on Rails and modern JavaScript frameworks like ReactJS, I bring a strong balance of backend reliability and frontend user experience to your development team.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        In my current role at Global Health, I have led mission-critical initiatives such as upgrading legacy Rails applications, implementing CI/CD pipelines, and enhancing test coverage beyond 80%. At my previous position with Employment Hero, I collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver secure, user-friendly platforms, integrated with multiple third-party providers. In addition to professional work, I actively contribute to open-source and develop side projectsâ€”from distributed workflow tools to real estate analytics platformsâ€”reflecting my passion for clean, maintainable, and meaningful code.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        What excites me most about joining the company is the opportunity to contribute to impactful projects, learn from talented peers, and solve real-world problems at scale. I value efficient processes, collaborative environments, and thoughtful engineering practices.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">
        Iâ€™ve attached my resume for your consideration and would welcome the chance to further discuss how I can contribute to the companyâ€™s goals. Thank you for your time and attention.
      </p>

      <p className="mt-4">Warm regards,<br />
      <strong>Tien Dau</strong>
      </p>
